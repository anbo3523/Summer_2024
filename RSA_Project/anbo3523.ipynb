In the beginning of this project, we will be outlining all the functions required to make this algorithm work. The functions we will be going over include the following: Convert_Binary_String, FME, Euclidean_Alg, EEA, Find_Public_Key_e, Find_Private_Key_d, Convert_Text, Convert_Num, Encode, and Decode. In each of the functions, there will be notes that go over what their purpose is and how they work to get the values we need. We will then generate our own public and private keys using the functions we created. Additionally, we will demonstrate the use of these functions by encoding our own message with our own prime numbers by going through each function we use, why, and the outputs that we receive. Then, we continue with the decoding process and demonstrate how we use the private key to decode our messages. We will also show additional examples of encoding and decoding by using examples provided by our peers. Finally, you will see how we can break the code using brute force and just the public key. You will find that smaller numbers will be quite easy to break, proving the importance of having a long key.  "

    "I am not typically the type of person to plan ahead. I tend to dive straight into tasks and figure things out as I go. I started off with the Mastery Workbook assignments which was due sooner than the RSA Project. A great thing about the most recent Mastery Workbook assignments was that it provided me with the framework to really understand how to start this project. The workbooks also had us program the Extended Euclidian Algorithm and the Fast Modular Exponentiation which I could use in this project. While doing this project, I’ve come to realize just how important it is to first sit down and organize your thoughts before jumping in and coding. In the past, I’ve spent days and weeks attempting to finish a coding assignment just because I decided to jump straight into coding without first understanding why the algorithm worked and without attempting to write pseudocode. The Mastery Workbook really had me break apart each part of the RSA algorithm and helped me understand how each function plays a part in the algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I put off doing the exchange with my classmates till I could completely run my code with success and accuracy, so I didn’t have to make many adjustments. I made a mistake by typing in one of my keys wrong which caused a massive jumble of random characters, however, I found the typo and was able to correct it.  I took the code I created for the Encode and Decode function and put it in another file so I can switch the n, d, and e to match whatever my classmates were using. This method prevented me from making any mistakes when attempting to decode their messages. It was a lot of fun decoding the messages and answering back in an encoded message. It reminded me of when I was a child making a new language with my friends so the adults wouldn’t understand what we were talking about. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging part of this project was the fact that I’ve never written in Python before I taken this class. All my code writing has been in C++ and/or assembly. I think this would be like trying to cook in another language. You know how cooking works and you’ve baked yourself a cake in the past, however, now it is in a whole new language you’ve never read before. You can easily understand the basic framework (you need to mix the dry ingredients, then the wet ingredients, and then combine them. Next, you would put the cake in the oven at x degrees), however, you don’t understand this particular recipe. You need to learn what “flour” means in another language. Funny enough, I would get so frustrated because I kept adding a semi-colon at the end of each of my lines out of habit and would have to go through and remove them because I kept getting compiling errors. Those were easy fixes; however, they were tedious.  \n",
    " \n",
    "Most of the resources I used were within Moodle and they were things I learned from the lessons from previous weeks. For instance, I was able to write my FME function because of Algorithm 5 on page 254 within the “Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications” book by Kenneth H. Rosen. Additionally, you can find pseudocode for the Euclidean Algorithm on page 269 of the same book. One thing I would like to point out is that for the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, I went the route of creating a loop that continuously applies the Euclidean Algorithm until b is 0. But after more research, I found we could have done this using recursion (calling the function within the function). I found this information in the following site: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/euclidean-algorithms-basic-and-extended/. They provide many resources for different algorithms, but I decided not to look there until after I figured out how I’d implement it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in a previous paragraph, my biggest hurdle was learning the syntax for Python. From the lack of semi-colons, to understanding how important it is to indent correctly, it took me a lot of time to understand how the language works. Even though it was very difficult for me to learn the language, I am glad I did. I know it will be very beneficial to my career to have a few languages under my belt. I don’t think I struggled as much on learning the algorithms because I really strengthened my programming skills after taking Data Structures at CU Boulder. I learned that with a lot of those algorithms, it’s important to figure out the basics and the theory behind it before you jump straight into programming. Do the calculations by hand first and see why it works. Additionally, if I struggle with any algorithm, what I will do is find someone’s implementation of it online, print it out, and go line by line and try to determine what the output is without running it on my computer. It can really help you understand what each line is doing within the code.  "
